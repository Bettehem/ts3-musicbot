<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>18.3 Data transmission to third parties</p>
<p>If we disclose personal information to third parties acting as agents of TeamSpeak USA, we will ensure that such third parties are also certified for the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield or have a resolution of appropriateness issued by the EU Commission, or that there are written agreements between us and the third party that at least meet Privacy Shield's privacy standards. To whom we disclose your personal information and for what purpose, please refer to the disclosures in this privacy statement regarding the specific use of TeamSpeak USA's information.</p>

<p>Information may also be collected offline, and attempts may be made to protect your personal information. For example, when you call, we only ask for the personal information we need to process the order or answer the question. When we need to store information, we enter it into our database using SSL encryption. Faxes are another example. If you fax us something, we respond to the fax and either store it in a locked room or we destroy the fax if the information does not need to be kept. It should be noted that we try to comply with the standards for data obtained online for data obtained offline.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

channel_codec_quality
channel_order
channel_maxclients
channel_maxfamilyclients
channel_flag_permanent
channel_flag_semi_permanent

channel_codec_latency_factor
channel_codec_is_unencrypted
channel_flag_maxclients_unlimited
channel_flag_maxfamilyclients_unlimited
channel_flag_maxfamilyclients_inherited
channel_flag_are_subscribed
channel_needed_talk_power
channel_forced_silence
channel_name_phonetic

Example:
   channelvariable cid=5 channel_topic channel_flag_permanent channel_codec
   cid=5 channel_topic=123 channel_flag_permanent=1 channel_codec=1
   error id=0 msg=ok

   channelvariable cid=5 channel_codec_quality|cid=1 channel_codec_quality
   cid=5 channel_codec_quality=7|cid=1 channel_codec_quality=10

Usage: channelcreate channel_name={channelName} [channel_properties...]

Creates a new channel using the given properties and displays its ID.

N.B. The channel_password property needs a hashed password as a value.
The hash is a sha1 hash of the password, encoded in base64. You can 
use the "hashpassword" command to get the correct value.

Example:
   channelcreate channel_name=My\sChannel channel_topic=My\sTopic
   cid=16
   error id=0 msg=ok

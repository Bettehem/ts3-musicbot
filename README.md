TS3 MusicBot lets you control and listen to your music from a TeamSpeak server's channel via the chat.<br>
<br>
TS3 MusicBot can play music from Spotify, YouTube and SoundCloud. Support for other services possibly coming in the future.<br>
TS3 MusicBot doesn't require you to be an admin on the server you are using the bot on, you only need permission to speak in the desired channel and use the chat.<br>
<br>
<h4>Features:</h4>

- Spotify Support! Unlike other bots, this Spotify support is legit!*<br>
- YouTube Support.<br>
- SoundCloud Support.<br>
- Built in Spotify, YouTube and SoundCloud search.<br>
- You can have tracks from Spotify, YouTube and SoundCloud all in the same queue!<br>
- Supports adding multiple tracks, albums and playlists etc. to the queue simultaneously.<br>
- Add whole playlists to the queue. This is something that isn't possible even in the official Spotify client!<br>
- Supports adding a Spotify artist's top tracks to the queue.<br>
- You can easily add content to the start, or the end of the song queue, or at any position you want!<br>
- Supports pre-shuffling. This makes it possible for example, to shuffle a playlist before it gets added to the queue. This is very useful if you don't want to shuffle the whole song queue!<br>
- Supports ncspot! If you don't want to use the official Spotify client, you can use ncspot, which is a lot lighter on system resources, but it requires a Spotify premium account.<br>
- And more...
<br>
<h4>Requirements:</h4>

- Linux based OS in a virtual machine or spare computer.<br>
- Works on Windows via WSL2, but configuration is harder than just installing an actual Linux OS.<br>
- MacOS might work if you install dependencies via homebrew, but this hasn't been tested.<br>

<h4>Installation:</h4>
Go to [Wiki](https://gitlab.com/Bettehem/ts3-musicbot/wikis/home) for instructions on installation.<br>
<br>
<h4>Commands:</h4>

- All commands start with the "%" character. You have to enter these in the chat of the channel your bot is connected to.<br>
- Check Command List wiki page for a list of commands: https://gitlab.com/Bettehem/ts3-musicbot/wikis/command-list<br>

*Other bots which claim to support Spotify, will only search for a song's data on Spotify, then enter it in a YouTube search and play the first result. This is especially problematic if you're trying to play a Spotify song that doesn't exist on YouTube. What you will get is a random video (not your song!) that might just have a similar name as your song. And even if the bot happens to find the correct match for your song on YouTube, the audio quality might still be a lot worse on YouTube than on Spotify.<br>
This problem doesn't exist on this bot, as it will search for the relevant Spotify data using their API, and then uses either the official Spotify client, or if the user so chooses, ncspot to play the songs straight from Spotify.<br>

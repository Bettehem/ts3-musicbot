TS3 MusicBot let's you control your music from a TeamSpeak servers channel via chat.<br>

TS3 MusicBot can play music from Spotify and YouTube. Soundcloud support and others possibly coming in the future.<br>
TS3 MusicBot doesn't require you to be an admin on the server you are using the bot on, you only need permission to speak in the desired channel and use the chat.<br>


<h4>Requirements:</h4>
- Linux based OS in a virtual machine or spare computer.<br>
- Works on Windows via WSL2, but configuration is harder than just installing an actual Linux OS.<br>
- MacOS might work if you install dependencies via homebrew, but this hasn't been tested.<br>


<h4>Installation:</h4>
Go to [Wiki](https://gitlab.com/Bettehem/ts3-musicbot/wikis/home) for instructions on installation.<br>

<h4>Commands:</h4>
- All commands start with the "%" character. You have to enter these in the chat of the channel your bot is connected to.<br>
- Check Command List wiki page for list of commands: https://gitlab.com/Bettehem/ts3-musicbot/wikis/command-list<br>
